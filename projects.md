### BeeTalk

#### Jan 2013 - Dec 2014

Garena's flagship instant messaging application, built for Android. 

I lead the engineering from scratch and go through the full development cycle until the features are stablized. The complexity lies in real-time communication and organize the engineering effort for a feature rich application. Most importantly, we make a couple of libraries to power the Android engineering in Garena. 

### Airpay Counter 

#### Dec 2014 - Now

Payment solution for SMEs in Thailand 

Started in late 2014, I lead a team of two to build the applicaiton. It is a esuccessful attempt for us to engineer the Android application with modern architecture, fully utilize dependency injection, job queue etc.
