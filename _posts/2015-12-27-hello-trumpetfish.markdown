Well, finally decide to open another blog about my projects and daily work.

#### Why Trumpetfish?

Saw quite a few trumpetfishes during my last dives. It is hard for me to remember the names of the fishes saw under the sea and trumpetfish is one of the few I can remember clearly. That's it. 

#### What's this blog about?

First of all, it serves as my portfoilo for software engineering and I would like to publish my thoughts for work occassionally. Secondly I would like to write stories on my exploration, expedition, photography, marathon and many other things.
